# personal-env-infrastructure

Infrastructure code for an environment of my Personal projects

Inside the `src` directory is where the central infrastructure is defined for personal projects. For example:

- Enabling of Cloud APIs
- Kubernetes Cluster & Node pool
- Central Database for re-use (since I'm too cheap to do proper microservice DB isolation)
